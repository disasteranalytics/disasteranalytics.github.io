									<h3>Computing Collective Sensemaking of Risk</h3>
									<p>Large-scale emergencies, including natural hazards and other man-made disasters, are an enormous threat to human societies and their national security. With the increased power of communication and advances in mobile technologies, research on crisis informatics has significantly contributed to disaster response; however, methods and tools for enhancing the resiliency of a society are still limited. The analysis of risk—regarded as a socially constructed phenomenon determined by dynamic social processes—is crucial to public disaster resilience. This research aims to investigate and build a data-driven, analytical infrastructure to support risk analysis from dynamic social processes—and from social media streams in particular—with a goal of enhancing disaster research and management.</p>
